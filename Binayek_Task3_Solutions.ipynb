            "1. Syndrome Measurement Without Collapse:\n",
            "   - Must extract error information without destroying quantum state\n",
            "   - Requires entangling data qubits with ancillas carefully\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Overhead:\n",
            "   - Need many physical qubits to encode few logical qubits\n",
            "   - Current hardware has limited qubit counts\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Noise in Error Correction Itself:\n",
            "   - Syndrome measurements and corrections introduce new errors\n",
            "   - Need error rates below threshold (~1% for surface codes)\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Real-time Classical Processing:\n",
            "   - Must decode syndromes and apply corrections quickly\n",
            "   - Decoherence times are short (~μs to ms)\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Circuit Depth:\n",
            "   - Error correction adds many gates\n",
            "   - Each gate is a potential error source\n",
            "   - Trade-off between protection and gate errors\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Fault-Tolerance:\n",
            "   - Errors in error correction can propagate\n",
            "   - Need fault-tolerant protocols (beyond scope here)\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Different Error Types:\n",
            "   - X, Z errors behave differently\n",
            "   - Need codes that handle both (like Shor)\n",
            "   - Correlated errors even harder\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Implementation Complexity:\n",
            "   - Require many controlled operations\n",
            "   - Not all gate types equally available on hardware\n",
